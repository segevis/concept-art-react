# Concept Art React (Vite)

This ports your Concept Art page into a React app with 4 routes: Home, Concept Art, Tattoos, Sketches.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Put your images
- Copy your existing `pic` folder (logo + back.png..back16.png) into `public/pic` so that paths like `/pic/back.png` work.

## Routes
- `/` Home
- `/concept-art` Concept Art (with lightbox)
- `/tattoos` Tattoos
- `/sketches` Sketches
